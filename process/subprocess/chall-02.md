## Challenge 02

Spawn an executable. Obtain the exit code (or return code) or executable upon program exit.

## Test

Run [runme.exe](resources/runme.exe) (windows) or [runme](resources/runme) (linux) and give `MII Cybersec` as argument.

Successfully running the process should print the exit code (code = 135).

Both are 32 bit executable. The source code is available as [runme.c](resources/runme.c).
