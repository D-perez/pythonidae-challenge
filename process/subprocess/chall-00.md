## Challenge 00

Spawn an executable. Pass a string argument to the subprocess.

## Test

Run [runme.exe](resources/runme.exe) (windows) or [runme](resources/runme) (linux) and give `MII Cybersec` as argument.

Successfully running the process will print the same value passed as argument.

Both are 32 bit executable. The source code is available as [runme.c](resources/runme.c).
