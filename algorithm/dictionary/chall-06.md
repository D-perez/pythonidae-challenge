## Challenge 06

Given a dictionary `D` and value `V`. 

Delete every key which have value `V`.

Note: as alternative, create new dictionary which had eliminated the keys.

## Test

Given a dictionary 

```
{
    "key1": 0,
    "key2": 2,
    "key3": 5,
    "key4": 5,
}
```

Removing all keys which have value 5 will give result

```
{
    "key1": 0,
    "key2": 2,
}
```

## Remarks

Filtering by value.
