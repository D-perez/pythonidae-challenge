## Challenge 07

Given two lists `K` and `V`. 

Create a dictionary where the key-value pair is combination of `K` and `V` at same index.

Note: handle the case when the length of two lists are not equal.

## Test

Given two list, `K` and `V`

```
K = [ "name", "hp", "mp" ]
V = [ "xathrya", "100", "32" ]
```

will produce new dictionary

```
{
    "name": "xathrya",
    "hp": "100",
    "mp": "32"
}
```

## Remarks

Create dictionary by list of keys and values.
