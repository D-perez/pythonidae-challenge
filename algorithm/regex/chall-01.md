## Challenge 01

Given a possible long text, find and extract valid IPv6 addresses.

An IPv6 address consists of 8 segments, separated by colons. Each segment is four hexadecimal digits which value ranged from 0 to ffff. 

If there are consecutive zeros, the IP representation can be shortened. For example, `2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334` become `2001:0db8::8a2e:370:7334`.
