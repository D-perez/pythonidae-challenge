## Challenge 10

Given a string `S`.

Create list of integer. Each element is ASCII representation of `S`.

## Test

Given a string `S`

```
"MII"
```

representing the string as list of character would give

```
[ 'M', 'I', 'I' ]
```

converting each element to integer will produce:

```
[ 77, 73, 73 ]
```
