## Challenge 09

Given two integers `S` and `E`, with `S` less than `E`.

Create a list of unique (non-repeating) integers with value from `S` to `E`. The position of the value is random.

## Test

Given integer `S = 3`, `E = 10`. One of possible result will be:

```
[ 3, 8, 7, 4, 10, 9, 6, 5 ]
```

From `S = 3` to `E = 10`, there are 8 integers.
