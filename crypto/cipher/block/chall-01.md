## Challenge 01

Given a string `S` and key `K`. 

Encrypt the string with `DES` and `ECB` mode. Encode the result in `Base64` encoding.

Note: you are free to use library or implement `DES` algorithm by yourself.

## Remarks

`DES (Data Encryption Standard)` is old standard which has been superseded by `AES`. The algorithm for encryption/decryption is known as `DEA (Data Encryption Algorithm)`.

DES used to be popular. Eventhough it's proven as broken, some (old) systems might still use it (or its sibling, `3DES`).
