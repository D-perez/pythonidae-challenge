## Challenge 07

Given a string `S` and key `K`.

Encrypt the string with `Camellia` and `CBC` mode. Encode the result in `Base64` encoding.

Note: you are free to use library or implement `Camellia` algorithm by yourself.

## Remarks

`Camellia` is a symmetric key block cipher with block size of 128 bits and key size of 128, 192, and 256 bits.

Alhtough less common, `Camellia` has been certified by several standards and supported in several products:

- TLS/SSL
- IPSec
- Kerberos
- OpenPGP
