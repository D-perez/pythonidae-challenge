## Challenge 03

Given a string `S` and key `K`.

Encrypt the string with `AES-128` and `ECB` mode. Encode the result in `Base64` encoding.

You are free to use library or implement `AES` algorithm by yourself.

## Remarks

`AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)`, is a specification for the encryption of data. The algorithm itself is a subset of `Rijndael` block cipher. The standard specify same algorithm for three different block size: 128, 192, and 256 bits.

`AES` is popular and widely used. Some system used `AES` in their communication and store the encryption hardcoded or in a configuration file.
