## Challenge 00

Generate string of random bytes with length `N`. Use secure random source. 

Make sure the result is unique, not recurred when code executed at different time.

## Remarks

One of crucial thing in encryption/decryption is the key. There are several way to obtain a key:

- supplied by the user
- generated or derived by system (random)

In the case of key, randomness is desired which lead to unpredictable ciphertext.
