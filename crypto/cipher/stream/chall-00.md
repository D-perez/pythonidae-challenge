## Challenge 00

Given a string `S` and key `K`.

Encrypt the string with `Salsa20`. Prepend the `nonce` before the ciphertext.

Note: you are free to use library or implement `Salsa20` algorithm by yourself.

## Remarks

`Salsa20` is a stream ciphers admitted as one of `eSTREAM` portofolio. The standard `Salsa20` require key size of 128 or 256 bits.

As `eSTREAM` portofolio, `Salsa20` (and `Chacha20`) is popular and widely used.
