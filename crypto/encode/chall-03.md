## Challenge 03

Given a string `S`.

Encode it with `uu encoding`. Verify te result by decoding it back and compare to original value.

You are free to use library or implement UU encoder/decoder by yourself.

## Test

Given string `S`

```
MII Cybersec
```

should produce

```
begin 666 input.txt\n,34E)($-Y8F5R<V5C\n \nend\n
```

## Remarks

The `uuencoding` is used to represent binary data in email systems. The name UU encoding is derived from "Unix-to-Unix encoding", which is designed as safe encoding to transfer Unix files from one Unix system to another Unix system.
