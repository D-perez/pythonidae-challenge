## Challenge 01

Given a string `S`.

Encode it with `Ascii85`. Verify te result by decoding it back and compare to original value.

You are free to use library or implement `Ascii85` encoder/decoder by yourself.

## Test

Given string `S`

```
MII Cybersec
```

should produce

```
O-V^0LwRCla&u*4
```

## Remarks

`Ascii85` or `Base85` is one of common encoding used in many cases. It is used to represent binary data. It is mainly used in Adobe's PostScript and Portable Document Format (PDF) file format.
