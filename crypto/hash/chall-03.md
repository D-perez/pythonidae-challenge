## Challenge 03

Given a string `S`.

Compute the `SHA-3` (`SHA3-256`) hash value.

Note: you are free to use library or implement `Keccak` hash algorithm by yourself.

## Test

Given string S

```
MII Cybersec
```

should produces

```

```

## Remarks

`SHA3 (Secure Hash Algorithm 3)` is a set of cryptographic hash function. SHA3 is a subset of `Keccak` hash family, as the winner of NIST standard.
