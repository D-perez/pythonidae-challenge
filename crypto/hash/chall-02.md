## Challenge 02

Given a string `S`.

Compute the `SHA-2` (`SHA-256` or 256-bits) hash value.

You are free to use library or implement `SHA-2` hash algorithm by yourself.

## Test

Given string `S`

```
MII Cybersec
```

should produces

```

```

## Remarks

`SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2)` is a set of cryptographic hash function. The family consists of six hash functions with digest that are 224, 256, 384, 512 bits: `SHA-224`, `SHA-256`, `SHA-384`, `SHA-512`, `SHA-512/224`, `SHA-512/256`.
