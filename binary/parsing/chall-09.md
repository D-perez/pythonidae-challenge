## Challenge 09

Given a path to executable `P` an integer `N`.

Open `P`, find the section which is located at the end of file. Expand the size of section with `N` pages. Save as new executable.

Note:

- the resulting executable should have `N` pages larger than original.
- the section information must be modified to reflect the change.

## Remarks

Creating code cave.

Instead of finding existing code cave, an executable can be expanded to have empty area.
