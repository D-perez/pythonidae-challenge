## Challenge 00

Open any executable file (PE / ELF). Interpret the header and find out the target architecture or the machine type of the executable.

## Remarks

Different architecture or cpu processor has different characteristics such as instruction set and register length. Executable for an architecture family are basically incompatible when ran on different architecture family. By knowing this, you can set a course of actions to properly analyze the executable.
