## Challenge 04

Open any executable file (PE / ELF). Calculate the entropy of each section.

You can use any library or parse the executable format manually.

## Remarks

In Information Theory, `Information Entropy` (or just `Entropy`) measures the randomness of sequence of data. The higher the Entropy (popular treshold: 7.5), the harder it is to draw any conclusion or pattern. Entropy often used to identify if the data has been transformed (encrypted or compressed).
