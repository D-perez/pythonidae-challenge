## Remarks

Token based authentication is a mechanism where a security token is given for every succesful authentication. The token is a value generated by server, usually has limited time period.

Each request to privileged area is restricted. Only when a request is accompanied by a signed token, it is able to proceed and allowed to fetch specific resource.

`JSON Web Token` (JWT) is open standard (RFC-7519) that defines a compact and self-combined method for securely transmitting information between parties encoded as a JSON object.

On system which use authentication and authorization mechanism, a request should be made to a single endpoint (ex: login) to grant a token.
