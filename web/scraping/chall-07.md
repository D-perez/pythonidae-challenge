## Challenge 07

Load content of a page of login form. Find the field for `username` and `password` entry. Do a brute force and check if certain combination of username and password is correct.

## Test

Given an URL

```
https://pythonidae.herokuapp.com/web/brute-login
```

The correct `username` is `pythonidae` and `password` is `pythonidae`

Correct credential will print message `Welcome`, otherwise it will print `Incorrect username/password combination`.
