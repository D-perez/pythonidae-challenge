## Challenge 01

Given IP and port.

Create a simple TCP client and connect to the server. Send any string as message and wait for the response.

## Test

There are several ways to emulate target server. One possible way is to use script from `socket/server/chall-00`.

## Remarks

Most protocol will initiate a communication by sending message first (i.e: banner). Some might require client to initiate.
