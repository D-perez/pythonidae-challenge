## Challenge 00

Given a domain name `D` and a list of string `L`. 

Create a simple HTTP client that connect to domain `D`. For each string in the list `L`, send request to fetch the path and check the status code on the response.

See HTTP code to determine the status. If file and directory exists, HTTP code 200 will be given as response.

Note: you are free to use library, but it is strongly recommended to manually do it.

## Remarks

Enumerate files and directories on HTTP server.
