## Challenge 01

Given an IP address `I`, a list of username `U`, a list of password `P`. 

Create a simple FTP client that connect to the `I`. Attempt to $$login using combination of username and password from `U` and `P`.

See FTP status code to determine the status.
Note: you are free to use library, but it is strongly recommended to manually do it.

## Remarks

Brute force FTP login.
