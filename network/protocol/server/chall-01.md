## Challenge 01

Create a simple DNS server which will always reply any name-resolving request with `127.0.0.1`.

Note: you are free to use library or implement the HTTP server by yourself.

## Remarks

Local DNS server is usually useful to redirect request, exist or non-exist domain, to local machine where analysis can be done. This "fake" DNS server is usually used to analyze traffic which going to suspicious or illegitimate domain.
